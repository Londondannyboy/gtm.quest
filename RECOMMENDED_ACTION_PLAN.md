## 🎬 Conclusion

You've built an excellent foundation with the new design. But launching it empty would be like:
- Opening a library with no books
- Starting a restaurant with no food
- Launching a marketplace with no sellers

**The smart move:** Use that beautiful new design to showcase the 500+ agencies and 1,000+ data points you already have on the current site.

**Result:** Best of both worlds in 4 months for £42,000 instead of worst of both in 12 months for £110,000.

**Content + Design = Success**
**Content OR Design = Failure**

Choose wisely. 🎯
